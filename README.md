# UnityChess

This is work I did for the Projects in Existing Code
The things that i worked on include:
Added Chess960 as a setup option, to do this simply press the "New 960 Game" Button
Changed the game so that it sets up the game to be you vs. the AI
Included a Run Tests button, this does run the tests that I made, however you will not see them unless you are in the unity editor and look at the console

UnityChess is a 3D Chess game built using Unity/C#.
